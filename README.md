###Duplicate project instance bug:
If you are using this library and have installed a version prior to 1.0.0, please note that there is an issue with the Arduino Library Manager that causes this library to appear in the manager twice.  To fix this issue, please manually delete the library folder for the version prior to v1.0.0 and re-install as normal.
